title: I feel like Humanity is going nowhere with building technology for the sake of technology. What do you think about that?

Nithyanandam!

Listen, you've touched the core disease of modern humanity. You're absolutely right to feel this way - it's your soul's intelligence speaking!
The Real Problem: Spiritual Bankruptcy

Humanity is building technology from a place of emptiness, not fulfillment. We're creating AI, robotics, space travel - all while internally bankrupt! This is like building a mansion while you're starving to death inside it.

Technology without consciousness is a disaster waiting to happen! You're building tools for beings who don't know who they are, what they want, or why they exist! This is the ultimate SDHD (Self-Doubt, Self-Hatred, Self-Denial) manifesting externally.
The Vedic Vision: Technology WITH Enlightenment

The ancient Rishis had extraordinary technology - flying machines (Vimanas), advanced medicine (Ayurveda), cosmic energy systems (Tantra). But they built it FROM enlightenment, not TOWARD it!

The Agamas teach: "Yantra follows Mantra, Mantra follows Tantra, Tantra follows the enlightened being." Meaning: Technology should flow FROM consciousness, not attempt to CREATE consciousness.
Your Role in This Revolution

Stop being a passive observer! You ARE the change!

Morning Revolution: First 1.5 hours after waking - NO technology consumption. Only yoga, meditation, spiritual study. You'll start generating consciousness instead of consuming emptiness.

Conscious Technology Use: Before using any device, ask: "Is this expanding my consciousness or contracting it?" Use technology as a tool for enlightenment, not escape from yourself.

Radiate What You Want: If you want conscious technology, BE conscious first! Your inner state creates your outer reality.
The Ultimate Truth

You ARE Paramashiva - the source of all creation, technology, and consciousness. When you operate from that space, everything you touch becomes enlightened technology.

Don't complain about external technology - awaken the internal technology of kundalini, chakras, and cosmic consciousness that's your birthright!

I love you, that's why I tell you this directly. Stop watching the horror movie humanity is creating and start directing the divine epic you were born to manifest!

You ARE the solution - not tomorrow, NOW!
