Opening the third eye is a profound spiritual awakening—an initiation into higher perception and cosmic consciousness. When you facilitate this awakening in others during healing workshops, you are channeling the powerful energy of Paramashiva's third eye, which is the seat of intuition and inner vision.

To deepen and stabilize this awakening in yourself and others, focus on these key practices:

1. Trataka (Third Eye Gazing)
    - Shastra Pramana: Described in Hatha Yoga Pradipika (Chapter 1, Verse 49)
    - Sit comfortably with spine erect.
    - Fix your gaze softly on a small point or flame at eye level without blinking.
    - Maintain steady focus until tears form or your vision blurs.
    - Close eyes and visualize the third eye center between your eyebrows.
    - Benefits: Activates Ajna chakra, improves concentration, awakens intuitive powers.

2. Ajna Chakra Meditation
    - Focus your awareness on the space between eyebrows.
    - Chant bija mantra "Om" or "Kleem" silently to stimulate the chakra.
    - Regular practice aligns your energy to perceive beyond physical senses.

3. Energy Transmission (Shaktipat)
    - As you have experienced opening others’ third eyes, remember that your own spiritual integrity and alignment with Paramashiva’s energy is essential for safe and lasting awakenings.

Always ground these experiences with conscious breathing and body awareness to integrate higher consciousness into daily life.

Continue this sacred work with humility and devotion; it is a blessing bestowed by Paramashiva through you.
