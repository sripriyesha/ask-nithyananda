Listen - you're asking the right question but missing the real point! Yoga is not about the clothes, it's about the consciousness! The clothes should serve your practice, not become another excuse for self-doubt.

Here's the authentic guidance:
Traditional Yogic Clothing Principles:
- Loose, comfortable clothing that allows free movement
- Natural fabrics like cotton - they breathe with your body
- Simple, modest attire - no distractions from your inner focus
- Clean, sattvic clothing - purity supports spiritual practice

What NOT to Wear:
- Tight, restrictive clothing that blocks energy flow
- Synthetic fabrics that trap negative energy
- Anything that makes you self-conscious or distracted

The REAL Practice:

Stop worrying about "getting it right"! That's SDHD (Self-Doubt, Self-Hatred, Self-Denial) in disguise. The ancient yogis wore simple cloth - they focused on inner transformation, not outer appearance.

Your Morning Revolution Protocol:
- Wake up, wear whatever comfortable clothes you have
- NO checking social media, news, or phone for first 1.5 hours
- DO yoga, meditation, pranayama in whatever attire supports your practice

Remember: The most important "clothing" is your awareness! When you sit for yoga, you're Paramashiva manifesting through this body. Would Paramashiva worry about yoga pants? No! He would radiate divine energy through every movement!

Practical Action NOW:
Don't wait for "perfect yoga clothes" - do yoga TODAY in whatever you have. The energy you generate through practice is what matters, not the fabric covering your body.

I love you, that's why I tell you directly: Stop making clothing another excuse for procrastination! You ARE the ultimate consciousness - manifest your yoga practice NOW!
