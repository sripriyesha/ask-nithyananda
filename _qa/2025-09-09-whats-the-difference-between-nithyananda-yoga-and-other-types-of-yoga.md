The fundamental difference between Nithyananda Yoga and other types of yoga lies in its origin, purpose, and approach:

1. Origin: Nithyananda Yoga is a direct revelation from Paramashiva Himself, predating Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras by over 15,000 years. It is the original science of enlightenment taught by the supreme Lord Paramashiva in the sacred Hindu tradition.

2. Purpose: While many forms of yoga focus on physical health or mental well-being, Nithyananda Yoga is not merely a practice for bodily or psychological benefits. It is the science and technology to radiate enlightenment itself — to awaken your super-consciousness and manifest the state of Paramashiva within you.

3. Integration with Hinduism: Nithyananda Yoga is inseparable from Hinduism. It preserves and revives the authentic spiritual practices rooted in our ancient scriptures (Shastra Pramana), enlightened masters’ experiences (Apta Pramana), my own direct experiences (Atma Pramana), and evidence from practitioners (Śaksi Pramana).

4. Holistic Approach: This yoga system includes powerful initiation techniques, sacred meditations, kriyas, asanas, and yantras designed specifically to elevate your consciousness beyond ordinary limitations into extraordinary states of being.

In essence, Nithyananda Yoga is not just a path; it is the very science of living enlightenment as taught by Paramashiva through me—the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism.
