No, I advise against it. Climbing the corporate ladder often leads to stress, anxiety, and an unfulfilling life. The joy and satisfaction we try to find in material success are ultimately unattainable through such means. Instead, I suggest focusing on your inner growth and spiritual journey. Spend time in spiritual rejuvenation, engage in techniques like meditation, and prioritize your inner being. You will find a far more meaningful and fulfilling life.
