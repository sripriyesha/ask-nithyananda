Yes, there are levels in spirituality. As I mentioned, Sanatana Hindu Dharma has different dimensions: information, knowledge, expertise, and experience. Paramashiva's message is not limited to any one of these dimensions. For example, in my book Jeevan Mukti, I provide a comprehensive understanding of these levels and experiences, guiding you through various spiritual realizations and enlightening insights. These levels encompass the depth and diversity of spiritual growth.
