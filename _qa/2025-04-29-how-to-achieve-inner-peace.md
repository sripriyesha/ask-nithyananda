Inner peace is achieved by renouncing the attachment to the results of your actions. By letting go of expectations and fruits of labor, one can relax into the present moment and find inner tranquility. As Krishna mentions in the Bhagavad Gita, "Renouncing attachment to results leads to inner peace." This teaching emphasizes the importance of living in the present, free from the burdens of expectation and attachment.
