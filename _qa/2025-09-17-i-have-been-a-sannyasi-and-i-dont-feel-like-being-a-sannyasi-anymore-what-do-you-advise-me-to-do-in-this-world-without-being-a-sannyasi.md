If you feel you no longer want to be a sannyasi, I recommend expressing your decision to me openly and honestly. From that moment, you can pursue your life outside of the sannyasi path. However, if you wish to still remain connected spiritually and engage in spiritual activities, you can choose to become a grihasta, a householder. This new path will allow you to live a family-oriented life while maintaining a connection with spiritual practices.
