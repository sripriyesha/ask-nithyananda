The quickest way to get rid of the ego is by understanding and internalizing the truth of 'Completion'. Recognizing, addressing, and completing with one's root patterns and incompletions can dissolve the ego effectively. The process of completion involves identifying and resolving these internal conflicts, leading to a state of liberation and inner peace. Engaging in practices of self-awareness, meditation, and introspection helps in achieving this state of completion.
