The types of karma can be explained through the analogy of bank accounts as follows:

1. **Sanchita Karma**: This is like a savings account where all your past deposits and withdrawals are stored. Every action you've performed in your past lives is recorded here. This account contains all the karma you have accumulatedâ€”whether positive or negative.
2. **Prarabdha Karma**: Imagine you've decided to withdraw a certain amount from your savings account to use in your current life. Prarabdha karma represents the portion of Sanchita karma that you are experiencing in this life. These are the situations and experiences you must go through now, due to past actions.
3. **Kriyamana Karma**: This corresponds to the deposits and withdrawals you make in your bank account on a daily basis. Every action, thought, or emotion you express now creates new karma that will influence your future. It's the karma currently being created, based on your present choices.
4. **Agami Karma**: Think of this as a planned future investment. The actions you undertake today may yield results in the future, though they have not yet materialized. Agami karma represents the potential consequences of your current actions that will manifest later.

In summary, just as a bank account requires careful management to ensure prosperity, understanding and managing your karma requires constant awareness of your actions and intentions. Invest in positive actions to enrich your life and the lives of others, while staying conscious of the consequences of every choice you make.
