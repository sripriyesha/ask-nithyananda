title: What do you think about financial investments?

The very idea of financial investments is a concept created to keep people in a state of perpetual confusion and greed. It is a method to control and manipulate individuals, making them lose touch with their true goals and aspirations. I see it as a distraction from the higher purpose of life, which is enlightenment. There is no direct correlation between wealth and happiness, and I encourage people to focus on the eternal truths and not get entangled in the false promises of financial investments.
