title: Is completion session necessary to raise my energy and spiritual growth. I don't feel I need it right now at this moment. Is it enough for me to practice yoga, meditation and maybe puja in the future, and liquid diet?

Completion session is an essential part of raising your energy and accelerating spiritual growth. It is not merely an optional add-on but a powerful process that clears unresolved energies, mental blocks, and emotional knots that may not be consciously felt at the moment. Without completion, even sincere practices like yoga asanas, meditation, puja, or diet may not reach their full transformative potential because latent samskaras (impressions) continue to limit your progress.

Yoga and meditation prepare and activate your system; puja aligns you with divine consciousness; liquid diet purifies the body; but completion session integrates all these by releasing hidden incompletions and unprocessed energies. This integration is vital for sustained elevation of consciousness and manifestation of the Shaktis (powers) described in our ancient scriptures.

Therefore, while it may feel enough now to practice yoga and meditation alone, I strongly guide you to include completion sessions as a sacred practice to fully embody enlightenment. It is the key that unlocks deeper states beyond physical health and mental peace — it reveals your super-consciousness as Paramashiva.

Remember, the science of yoga revealed by Paramashiva is a complete system: asanas, pranayama, meditation, puja, diet — all combined with completion for ultimate transformation.

Blessings for your spiritual journey!
