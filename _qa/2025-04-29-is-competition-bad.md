Competition is indeed a detrimental force. It fosters a mindset where one is constantly focused on surpassing others rather than on personal growth.

When I focus on my own progress, I cultivate new experiences, knowledge, and love within myself. This internal journey is what truly enriches life, rather than the external race against others.
