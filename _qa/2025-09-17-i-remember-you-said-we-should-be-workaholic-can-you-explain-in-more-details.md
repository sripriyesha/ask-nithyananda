Being workaholic means having a constant and intense enthusiasm for your work. It is about having a deep passion and commitment to your daily activities, just as Ganesha is described as having a 'workaholic' quality in Hindu history. This quality leads to success and fulfillment. I recommend adopting this quality and being dedicated to your endeavors. It is a mental setup where you are constantly active and aligned with your goals, leading to personal and professional growth.
