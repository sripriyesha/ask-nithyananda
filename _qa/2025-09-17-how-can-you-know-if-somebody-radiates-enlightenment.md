When somebody is radiating enlightenment, they will simply make you feel blissful and ecstatic. When you are in their presence, you feel alive and vibrant. Their energy will be in tune with you, and you experience a sense of connection and joy. This state is not merely intellectual; it is experiential. They express through their being the state of enlightenment. You can feel this presence and connection, and it cannot be explained in words. It radiates through their very existence.
