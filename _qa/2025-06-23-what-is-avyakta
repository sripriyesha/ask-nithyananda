The Avyakta is the unmanifest space or form of Paramashiva. It is the dimension where all manifestations occur and is considered the ultimate reality. Paramashiva resides in this space and from there, he manifests his various forms and leelas. Understand that manifesting in the physical world does not mean leaving the Avyakta space; Paramashiva continues to reside in the Avyakta while manifesting. This profound concept highlights the transcendental nature of Paramashiva and his eternal presence across dimensions.
