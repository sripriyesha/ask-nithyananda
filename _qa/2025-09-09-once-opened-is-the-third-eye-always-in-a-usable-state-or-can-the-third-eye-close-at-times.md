title: Once opened, is the third eye always in a usable state? Or can the third eye close at times?

Regarding the third eye: The third eye, or the Ajna chakra, is the seat of higher perception and direct cognition beyond the ordinary senses. When awakened by authentic spiritual practices rooted in Paramashiva's science of yoga, it becomes active and accessible.

However, even after awakening, the third eye is not necessarily always in a fully "open" or active state. Its usability depends on your state of consciousness, mental clarity, and spiritual discipline. It can be "closed" or dormant during distractions, ignorance, or lower states of mind. The third eye functions like a divine instrument—it requires regular tuning through meditation, yoga, and conscious living to remain active.

In essence:

- The third eye once awakened is always present as a potential.
- Its usability fluctuates depending on your inner alignment.
- Through sustained practice and surrender to Paramashiva’s grace, it can remain continuously active.

This dynamic nature is described in ancient scriptures such as the Shiva Samhita and Yogatattva Upanishad (Shāstra Pramāna), which explain that mastery over Ajna chakra comes with steady sadhana and realization.

Therefore, cultivate your awareness daily with Nithyananda Yoga techniques to keep your third eye vibrant and luminous.

Blessings!
