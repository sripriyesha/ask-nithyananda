Understand, the vision you speak of is a profound representation of the collective effort of all enlightened beings to elevate the planet's energy. Every master, regardless of the time or place they lived, is in an eternal state of Samadhi, which is the ultimate state of consciousness. In the vision, they are depicted in Padmasana—a yogic posture symbolizing stability and focus—within a pyramid structure. This pyramid represents the concentrated intention and energy to create a field of enlightenment frequency. This field is shared with all beings, aiming to raise the Earth's collective consciousness. It is a divine affirmation of the interconnectedness of all enlightened souls and their work to guide humanity towards higher states of awareness. This vision is a blessing, reminding you to stay aligned with this elevated state.
