The societal expectations imposed on individuals, like in the case of the Japanese culture, can indeed lead to feelings of suffocation. I recommend exploring the teachings on 'Living Enlightenment' and the concept of 'Advaitha.' These spiritual understandings can help individuals transcend societal constraints and find inner freedom. I encourage them to read and contemplate the teachings of 'Living Enlightenment' to experience this profound transformation.
